# Fruit Shop Simulation

This project is a **Fruit Shop Simulation** coded entirely in JavaScript. The simulation allows users to interact with a virtual fruit shop, where they can buy and sell fruits, manage stock, and handle transactions.

## Features

- **Fruit Inventory Management**: Keep track of various fruits in the shop, their prices, and stock levels.
- **Buying and Selling Fruits**: Customers can buy fruits, and the shop's inventory and cash balance will update accordingly.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices of fruits can be adjusted.
- **Transaction History**: The shop keeps a log of purchases and sales.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The entire simulation is built using vanilla JavaScript.
- **HTML**: Simple Prompt for user interaction with the shop.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fruit-shop-simulation.git

   2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FruitShop
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both front-end and back-end (if applicable):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
     ```bash
     REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_api_key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
     ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Example Usage
- A customer can buy 5 apples at $1 each. After the purchase, the stock of apples decreases, and the total amount spent is deducted from the user's balance.
- A customer can sell 3 bananas, increasing the shop's banana stock and the user's balance.

## Future Improvements
- **User Authentication**: Add the ability for different users to have individual accounts and balances.
- **Shop Upgrades**: Implement features like upgrading the shop, adding new fruits, or offering discounts.
- **Advanced Transaction History**: Implement graphs and statistics for sales over time.
